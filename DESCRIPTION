Description: R-based access to a large set of data variables relevant to forest ecology in raster format at 100m resolution
    in BC Albers projection, hosted on the Federated Research Data Repository with <doi:10.20383/101.0283>.
    Collection includes: elevation; biogeoclimatic zone; wildfire; cutblocks; forest attributes from
    Hansen et al. (2013) <doi:10.1139/cjfr-2013-0401> and Beaudoin et al. (2017) <doi:10.1139/cjfr-2017-0184>; and FIDS survey maps
    for a number of insect pest species, all covering the period 2001-2018. Users supply a polygon or point location in the
    province of BC, and 'rasterbc' will download and merge the overlapping raster tiles hosted at the Federated Data Repository
    (FRDR), returning the result in R as a SpatRaster. Metadata associated with these layers, and code for downloading them
    from their original sources can be found in the github repository <https://github.com/deankoch/rasterbc_src>.
