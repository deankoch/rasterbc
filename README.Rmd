# rasterbc

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

rasterbc provides a simple set of helper functions for accessing a large set of spatial ecological data on the province of BC during the period 2001-2018, in raster format for analysis in R.

Metadata associated with these layers, and code for downloading them from their original sources can be found in a sister repository, [rasterbc_src](https://github.com/deankoch/rasterbc_src), and all raster data files will be hosted as a data publication (with associated DOI) on [FRDR](https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/) for permanence and easy referencing. 

## Installation

This package is still in development, but a release on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) is planned in the near future. For now the package may be tested by installing the `devtools` package (run `install.packages('devtools')`), and running the following two lines:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github('deankoch/rasterbc')
```


## Example

(boilerplate examples, to be replaced soon) This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rasterbc)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
